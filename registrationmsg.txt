Thank you for registering for the longitudinal study! This study will ask you, once per year, to take a brief survey to get your impression about your education and your professional career. These results will help us understand whether the Software Enterprise is achieving its goals of producing industry-ready software engineers.

We are currently seeking volunteers to help us with a deeper more advanced assessment. If you have 30 minutes to volunteer, please email Dr. Gary at kgary@asu.edu.

We are also looking for your professional supervisor/mentor to participate if s/he has the time. We would like her/him to take a short survey as well, so if you think your mentor would be willing, please email Dr. Gary.
