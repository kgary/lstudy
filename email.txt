Dear Current ASU Student or ASU Alum,

You are being contacted because you completed at least one of the four courses from the capstone project sequence called "The Software Enterprise" at ASU. As part of a National Science Foundation grant, we are asking you to participate in a study of the effectiveness of Enterprise teaching methods The study is a longitudinal study; a survey you will be asked to complete once a year. The survey takes about 10 minutes to complete, and the results are completely anonymous. Of course you are under no obligation whatsoever to participate.

If you choose to participate, please start with an online reservation process at [system generated URL]. This process maintains your anonymity while allowing you to participate in subsequent years.

We hope you choose to participate and help us do a better job for our students. If you have any questions on the research study, please contact the Principal Investigator Dr. Kevin Gary at kgary@asu.edu.

Thanks and best regards.
Dr. Gary
